Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
The Force will be with you. Always.
Never tell me the odds!
Do. Or do not. There is no try.
No. I am your father.
I’ll never turn to the dark side. You’ve failed, your highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.
Now, young Skywalker, you will die.
Just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes.
There’s always a bigger fish.
In time, the suffering of your people will persuade you to see our point of view.
You can’t stop the change, any more than you can stop the suns from setting.
The Force is strong with this one.
If you only knew the power of the dark side.
Remember…the Force will be with you, always.
You were the chosen one!
Chewie, we’re home.
Fear is the path to the dark side.
Someday I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.
It's over Anakin! I have the high ground!
